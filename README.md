# Double Exposure Technique in p5.js
## Part 1: Imaging Technique
### Double Exposure
One imaging technique that inspires me is **double exposure**, commonly used in photography and film to create a surreal, dream-like effect by overlaying two images. I would like to incorporate this technique into my project to blend the subject with its environment or emotions, creating a deeper narrative.

This technique offers:
- A visually striking composition
- Enhanced symbolic expression
It aligns with the assignmentâ€™s focus on **creativity and conceptual depth**, while the unique visual impact of double exposure makes the storytelling more **emotionally expressive**.

- ![second image of Double Exposure](week8pics\week8pic2.jpeg)

## Part 2: Coding Technique
### Image Blending in p5.js
A **coding technique** that can assist in achieving the double exposure effect is **image blending using p5.js**. The **blend()** function in p5.js allows you to overlay two images using different blending modes, such as:
- ADD
- MULTIPLY
- OVERLAY
This technique enables:
- Dynamic control over the composition
- Smooth transitions between images
- Creation of multi-layered visuals for the double exposure effect
Example Code:
You can find a detailed implementation of image blending in p5.js in this p5.js Image Blending Example, [Blend] https://p5js.org/reference/p5.Image/blend/

Image Example:
Below is an example of image blending in p5.js, demonstrating how two images can be overlaid to create a complex, layered visual:

By using this coding technique, I can achieve the **double exposure effect** for my project, aligning with the creative and technical requirements of the assignment.
